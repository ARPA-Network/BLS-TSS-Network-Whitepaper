# ARPA Network Whitepaper Version 0.2

### Abstract
ARPA Network provides an efficient, permissionless threshold signature service for blockchains. At its core, the ARPA Network contains a threshold BLS signature that meets the need for decentralization, non-interactivity, verifiability, and high availability. The system is designed and implemented to work with blockchains and provide threshold signature capability for users. Nodes of the ARPA Network are grouped to handle computation tasks in parallel. We utilize a smart-contract-capable blockchain as a bulletin to manage dynamic global states and coordinate multiple groups. It is expected that developers can build applications like secure key management, cross-chain messaging, and quorum approval premised on our network. Finally, Randcast is proposed as a distributed random number generator as a use case of the ARPA network.
