# ARPA Network Whitepaper Version 0.2

### Abstract
ARPA Network provides an efficient, permissionless threshold signature service for blockchains. At its core, the ARPA Network contains a threshold BLS signature that meets the need for decentralization, non-interactiveness, verifability, and high availability. The design and implementation of the network is premised on enhancing the blockchain and providing the threshold signature capability for users. Finally, Randcast is proposed as a distributed random number generator as a use case of the ARPA network.
