\section{Introduction}

Like the physical world, where the whole universe is built upon random motions of molecules, random numbers are ubiquitous and essential in the Metaverse. Randcast provides randomness capability to blockchains and Web 3.0. A trustworthy and reliable pseudo-random number generator is a cornerstone to either blockchain infrastructures or applications built upon. In terms of the decentralized and trustless nature of the blockchain, the randomness should also be tamper-proof, disitributely generated and verifiable. 

\subsection{Randcast Features}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Decentralization, Randcast produces random number in a decentralized manner, entropy is gathered from multiple entities located in different regions running individual nodes. This manner offers unpredictability and fairness in the physical level.
    \item Uniqueness, Randcast generates random numbers depending only on request messages and node secrets. Given certain signing group and user input, the randomness is unique and tamper-proof which mitigates corruption inside the network.
    \item Verifiability, Randcast provides everyone the ability to check the validity of random number. By virtue of underlying cryptographic primitive, The random number is unlikely to be forged or manipulated
    \item Non-interactive, Randcast avoids heavy synchronous communication in the random generation phase. An non-interactive procedure guarantees a better service status.
    \item High availability, Randcast owns a high availability thanks to its decentralization and non-interactive. With the growth of its network size, the downtime will reduce accordingly.
    \item Multiple Chain Supported, Randcast is designed to adapt to multiple chains, which facilitates developers from multiverse casting “randomness” spells. Our underlying threshold signature network will keep consistency between the different data replicas.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{ARPA Features}
\begin{itemize}

\section{Prosuppositions}

While building an underlying threshold signature service for the blockchain, we should firstly clarify the security and communication model. The following outlined assumptions are highly relevant to the characteristics of blockchain, where the system is distributed and permissionless while the participants are economically rational but potentially malicious.

\subsection{Security Assumption}

We assume that a static, malicious, honest-majority adversary. The attacker can corrupt up to $t$ of the $n$ parties in the network in one time, where $t < n/2$. The corrupted parties may divert from the prescribed protocol in any way. Considering the malicious behaviors, honest-majority is the best achievable threshold for protocols that provide both secrecy and robustness \cite{gennaro2007secure}. The static adversary would chooses the corrupted parties far ahead of time which means getting control of particular party is non-trivial. But it is possible that the corrupted parties may vary during a long time. Key rotation or refreshment scheme is introduced to cope with the long-term key exposure.

\subsection{Communication Model}

The distributed signature network is composed of a set of $n$ parties $P_1, \cdots, P_n$ that connected by a complete network of private point-to-point channels. In addition, the parties have access to a dedicated broadcast channel. Several works\cite{kate2009distributed,kate2012distributed,cachin2002asynchronous} have researched on the threshold signature without a preset reliable broadcast. They assimilate various secret sharing schemes into reliable broadcast or consensus protocol. e.g. AVSS\cite{cachin2002asynchronous} merges a bivariate polynomial into Bracha’s reliable broadcast \cite{bracha1984asynchronous}. Gennaro\cite{gennaro2007secure} leverages Byzantine fault tolerant protocol\cite{castro1999practical} to build the DKG for the Internet. It can be concluded from these articles that constructing a reliable broadcast channel is equivalent to reaching a consensus among nodes. Considering there are kinds of blockchains and smart contracts that help us broadcast and record messages publicly, it is reasonable to offload this part of protocol to blockchains.

\subsection{Synchrony Assumption}

Based on the block generation mechanism, we may assume a partially synchronous communication model: protocol proceeds in synchronized rounds and messages are received by their recipients within some specified time bound. The block time of a blockchain that guarantees liveness can be used as the synchronized clock in the threshold signature. The drawback is that the typical value of the block time is several orders of magnitude larger than that of an Internet transmission. The partial synchrony opens up an attack way for the adversary that, in each round of communication, he can wait for the messages of the uncorrupted parties to arrive, then decide on his computation and communication for that round, and still get his messages delivered to the honest parties on time. In the worst case, the adversary may speak last in every communication round to exploit the back-running.

Although asynchronous verifiable secret sharing scheme is intractable to design, there are several works researching on it. Unconditionally secure AVSS has a communication complexity of $\Omega(n^5)$, making it unrealistic to use. Comprimising the unconditional security assumption 

\section{Randcast Protocol}

To provide a threshold signature service, Randcast combines threshold BLS signature with block-chains. In high level, The user call the Randcast protocol by sending a transaction on the blockchain. The task will be assigned to one group of network nodes. The nodes collectively generate a signature on the message provided by the user. The threshold BLS signature is comprised of two main parts, distributed key generation and threshold signature. Randcast protocol also defines the procedure of nodes registration, secession and grouping.

\subsection{Distributed Key Generation}

A distributed key generation (DKG) protocol is an essential component of threshold cryptosystems reponsible for generating private and public keys of participants. Typically, the key management policy and signature generation algorithm is fundamentally determined by the underlying secret sharing scheme used in the DKG. This is because DKG decides the relationship of key shares hold by each node

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Joint-Feldman Distributed Key Generation\cite{gennaro2007secure}}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Require Adversary threshold $t$, group size $n$, modulus $p$, BLS underlying field $\mathbb{F}_q$
\Ensure Shamir secret shares $s_i$ for party $P_i$ respectively
\State Each party $P_i$ chooses a $f_i(z) = \sum_{j=0}^t a_{ij}z^{j}$, where $a_{ij} \in_R \mathbb{Z}_q$, broadcasts commitment $C_{ik} = g^{a_{ik}} \bmod p$ for $k \in [0,t]$. Each party $P_i$ computes the shares $s_{ij} = f_i(j) \bmod q$ for $j \in [1,n]$ and sends $s_{ij}$ to party $P_j$ secretly.
\State Each party $P_j$ verifies the shares his received shares $g^{s_{ik}} = \prod_{k=0}^t(C_{ij})^{j^k} \mod p$ for $k \in [1,n]$. If the check for an index i fails, $P_j$ raises a compliant against party $P_i$
\State Party $P_i$ reveals the shares corresponding to raised complaints. Each party $P_j$ check the validity between complaints and equations. Any failed party will be contained in local disqualified set of each every party, while $QUAL$ is the set of non-disqualified parties.
\State The public value $y$ is computed as $y = \prod_{i\in QUAL} a_{i0} \bmod p$. The public verification values are computed as $P_k = \prod_{i\in QUAL} C_{ik} \bmod p$ for $k = 1,\dots, t$. Each party $P_j$ sets his share of the secret as $x_j = \sum_{i\in QUAL} s_{ij} \bmod q$. The secret shared value $x$ itself is not computed by any party, but it is equal to $x = \sum_{i \in QUAL} a_{i0} \bmod q$.
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}


verification of each parties' partial signature

\subsection{threshold BLS signature}

Boneh-Lynn-Shacham (BLS) signature is first proposed as a short signature scheme where the signatures consist only of a single group element. ElGamal type schemes such as digital signature algorithm (DSA) and elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) produces signatures comprised of a pair of integers. Therefore, BLS signatures are about half of the length of those produced by other widely used schemes at the same security level\cite{menezes2009introduction}.

BLS signatures utilize a bilinear pairing which offers several interesting features. Firstly, determinism
Secondly, aggregatablity 

The scheme is provably secure under the CDHP, assuming the hash function acts like a random oracle

They are deterministic in the sense that a BLS signature depends only on the message and the signer’s key unlike other signature schemes, such as ECDSA, which require a fresh random value for each signed message to be secure. Put differently, any two BLS signatures on a given message produced with the same key are identical. 

The BLS signature scheme consists of the following sub-procedures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[] \textbf{Key Generation} To generate a key pair, a signer first chooses a random secret $sk \in_R \mathbb{Z}_p^*$ and computes the corresponding public key as $pk = g_2^{sk} \in \mathbb{G}_2$.
    \item[] \textbf{Signature Generation} To compute a BLS signature $\sigma$ on a message $m$, the signer simply computes $\sigma = skH(m) \in \mathbb{G}_1$. $H(m)$ is a hash-to-curve function that maps arbitrary bit string to element in $\mathbb{G}_1$
    \item[] \textbf{Signature Verification} To verify that a BLS signature $\sigma$ on a message $m$ is valid, the verifier checks if $e(H(m),X)=e(\sigma,g_2)$ holds using the signer's public key $pk$. It is easy to see that this equation holds for valid signature since
    \begin{equation}
        e(H(m),X)=e(H(m),g_2^x)=e(H(m),g_2)^x=e(xH(m),g_2)=e(\sigma,g_2)
    \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

The goal of a threshold signature scheme is to collectively compute a signature by combining individual partial signatures independently generated by the participants. A threshold BLS signature scheme has the following sub-procedures:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[] \textbf{Key Generation} The $n$ participants execute a $t$-of-$n$ DKG to setup a collective public key $pk \in \mathbb{G}_2$, and private key shares $sk_i \in \mathbb{Z}_p^*$ of the virtual private key $sk$.
    \item[] \textbf{Partial Signature Generation} To sign a message $m$, each participant $P_i$  uses his private key share $sk_i$  to create a partial BLS signature $\sigma_i=sk_i \times H(m)$.
    \item[] \textbf{Partial Signature Verification} To verify the correctness of a partial signature $\sigma_i$ on $m$, a verifier uses the public key share $pk_i$, which is generated during the DKG, and verify that $e(H(m)),pk_i=e(\sigma_i.g_2)$.
    \item[] \textbf{Signature Reconstruction} To reconstruct the collective BLS signature $\sigma$ on $m$, a verifier first need to gather $t$ different and valid partial BLS signature $\sigma_i$ on $m$ followed by a Lagrange interpolation on them.
    \item[] \textbf{Signature Verification} To verify a collective BLS signature $\sigma$, a verifier simply checks that $e(H(m),pk)=e(\sigma,g_2)$ where $pk$ is the public key.
\end{itemize}

Thanks to the properties of Lagrange interpolation, the value of $\sigma$ is independent of the subset of $t$ valid partial signatures $\sigma_i$ chosen during signature reconstruction. Additionally, Lagrange interpolation also guarantees that no set of less than $t$ signers can predict or bias $\sigma$. In summary, a threshold BLS signature $\sigma$  exhibits all properties required for publicly-verifiable, unbiasable, unpredictable, and distributed randomness.
